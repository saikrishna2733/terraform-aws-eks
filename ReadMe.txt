Hi Team,

As per my observation and after detail troubleshooting, I understood that, after the creation of the EKS cluster when the user executes any deployments using CICD or HELM charts, the cluster automatically creates a load balancer end point url which is causing the problem to destroy the cluster.

I am not sure that this problem is in terraform or in AWs EKS cluster. 


Hope you userstand the clarifications.

If you require any help. kinldy reach me out.
